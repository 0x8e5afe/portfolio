# 🛡️ Giuseppe Toscano – Cybersecurity & AI Security Portfolio

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website.  
I use it to showcase my work as a **Penetration Tester & AI Security Engineer** – experience, skills, projects, and a contact form, all wrapped in a dark, terminal-inspired UI.

If you’re building your own portfolio and like the style, **feel absolutely free to use this as a starting point, fork it, or adapt it**.  
Change the content, colors, icons, or structure to match your profile.

## 🧩 What’s Inside

- **`index.html`** – The entire portfolio is a single-page layout:
  - Hero section with animated “terminal” intro.
  - About section (short bio).
  - Experience timeline.
  - Technical skills (offensive security, AI security, development, etc.).
  - Education & certifications.
  - Projects (e.g., CyberSuite).
  - Contact form with Web3Forms + basic client-side validation and a confetti effect on success. 🎉

- **Inline CSS & JS** – All styling and scripts live directly inside `index.html` for simplicity.  
  No build tools, no bundlers, no frameworks required.
